# cardiology-databasle.sql
A project I created for the CodeFirstGirls degree course using SQL. This database is for use in hospital cardiac diagnostics. It allows for the recording of referrals, waiting times, tests ordered and results. This means that queries can be used to analyse the performance of the department and the waiting times for patients. It allows analysis of the tests ordered depending on patient symptoms and the results from the tests performed. The Database can be updated if the patient undergoes further tests and results can also be added. Patients are identified by their ID number. Tables are connected by primary key of ID.
